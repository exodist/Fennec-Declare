NAME
    Fennec::Declare - Declarative interface for Fennec.

DESCRIPTION
    This is a declarative interface for Fennec. In short this improves the
    syntax used to define tests with Fennec.

    No more name => sub
    no more semicolon to end the test sub.
    overrides describe, cases, case, it, tests, before_* after_*
            describe name { ... }

        instead of

            describe name => sub { ... };

SYNOPSIS
        package Declare::Test;
        use strict;
        use warnings;

        use Fennec::Declare;

        tests foo {
            ok( 1, "Declarative test!" );
        }

        tests old => sub {
            ok( 1, "old style" );
        };

        describe blah {
            tests group_a { ok( 1, 'a' )}
            tests group_b { ok( 1, 'b' )}
            tests group_c { ok( 1, 'c' )}
            tests group_d { ok( 1, 'd' )}
            tests group_e { ok( 1, 'e' )}
            describe foo {
                tests group_x { ok( 1, 'x' )}
            }
        };

        tests todo_group (todo => "This is a todo group") {
            ok( 0, "This should fail, no worries" )
        }

        tests should_fail (should_fail => 1) {
            die "You should not see this!"
        }

        tests skip_group (skip => "This is a skip group") {
            ok( 0, "You should not see this!" )
        }

        1;
